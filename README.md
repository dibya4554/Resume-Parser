# 📄 Resume Parser & Job Matcher System (Python)

A Python-based Resume Parsing and Job Matching system that extracts candidate information from resumes and compares it with job descriptions to calculate compatibility scores.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of text processing, file handling, and similarity matching techniques used in real-world recruitment systems.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The system performs the following operations:

* Extracts text from resumes (PDF, DOCX, TXT formats)
* Parses candidate skills and information
* Reads job description requirements
* Matches resumes against job descriptions
* Calculates similarity score
* Identifies best-fit candidates

The project simulates how modern Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) screen resumes.
